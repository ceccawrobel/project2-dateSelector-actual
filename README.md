**description**

This webpage was created for a code review in the Epicodus part-time Intro to Programming course.

This repository contains a webpage for contestants on a dating show to give basic information about themselves in order to be matched up with potential partners.

**instructions**
1. Look at the labels on the form.
2. Enter information to the fields as indicated by each label.
3. Look at the code.
4. Consider: Does it make sense? Is it easy to look at?
5. If anything doesn't make sense, you can [let me know](mailto:ceccawrobel@gmail.com). You may also keep it to yourself! But I'm not too proud to accept feedback if you feel so inclined.
